# The World of Grattum
}}

::

### Large Planet with Two Moons  
- Sil'Dorken
- Fal'Dormem (Formerly Fal'Doren)

### Peoples
- Denizens - **Grattari**
- Magical Universal Language - **Grattan**
  - Once learned, unlearn all other languages
  - Can understand all languages, can only speak Grattan

### Religion


Religion in Garttum is very much Science mixed with Spirits
- Grattari don't worship deities in the traditional sense.
- They worship the stars in they sky above them.
  - Rakkme (The Sun) The Raging Father
  - Sil'Dorken (Medium Moon, Desolate) The Dead Mother
  - Fal'Dormem/Fal'Doren (Small Moon, Sand)/(Small Moon, Lush) The Dormant Child/ The Living Child
:
Magic/Science Meld complete mix, T1 Civilization, moving to T2

Made Eternium Alloy - Obsidian/Adamantine Mix
Channels magic and engery better than any other substance.

## Infinitus Maxima
*Mega-Metropolis - 780M Residents*

Super masssive city that takes up nearly a quarter of the planets size. Eternum Pylons and Pilliars thorughout the city to coaless into a energy tractor beam. (No dyson sphere, but more siphon energy from sun into planet- Probably consistitutes T1.5 Civ)
:
4 Quadrants - Act as rings like from AoT
### Far Outer Ring - Mel'skett (The Frailty)
  - 32 Inner Disctricts (Slums, Communal living, Guardhouses, Agriculture, Access to Outlands)
#### **Sal'Gevas**
*(Created by Drew)*

A decedent oasis city in the middle of a desert. Drugs, prostitution and gambling are rife in this city of sin. The mayor of the city is a patsy for the true leaders of the city, an elven crime family.

#### **Semerang**
*(Created by Frank)*

Semerang is less a city and more an extensive collection of hovels built on top of each other on a pensinsula where sea water meets the mouth of a river. 

#### **Umovi**
*(Created by Alfredo)*

settlement depends on mages for food, magic centric community, magic sciency stuff motivated by greed to increase yield, town grows, makes a slum of people that cant afford efficient unethical magic. all because they settled a spot that cannot be reached by trade easy
### Middle Outer Ring - Ful'Murit (The Strength)
  - 16 Inner Disctricts
    - < need to figure out what goes here >
### Middle Inner Ring - Rakk'Mera (The Reach)
  - 8 Inner Disctricts
     - Main housing of the Eternium Pylons
     - Science houses, High Government, Worker housing
### Inner Ring - Sil'Herra (The Heart)
  - 4 Inner Disctricts
     - Nobility, Relgious Leadership, Military, Chosen of previous 3 houses
\page
### Class Changes
- Harnessers, Cyberbeasts, and Artificers created rifts to Fal'Doren when it was lush and created pylons on that moon as an anchor point.

#### Class Changes
- Barbarian - Wildkin
- Druid - Cyberbeast
- Fighter - Malechite
- Ranger/Rogue - Synth
- Artificer - unlocked
- Wizard - Harnesser
- Monk - Planetspeaker
- Paladin,Cleric,Bard,Warlock,Sorcerer - Unavailable
:
Wildkin, Cyberbeasts, and Planetspeakers formed a Sect of Society known as Land Dwellers. This class would be responsible for communing with nature and keeping the balance and order of Modern Civilization and Natural Essence of the world.
:
Malechites, Synths, and Harnessers formed the Nobles of Society, building vast structures and maintining the Mega Metropolis. Harnessers would weild the Weave itself as a blacksmith weilds a hammer. Synths would sow discourse in lower classes of civilization to keep them in order and under the heel of higher houses. Malechites would be the massive army of guards and muscle.

{{pageNumber,auto}}

The Grand Mistake
---------
When attempting to Harness the power of their sun, they channeled Weave Energies into the Eternium Plyons, attempting to suck the power of the sun to the planet. Using their Moon Fal'dormem as a conduit and gravity anchor, they would channel this concentrated beam towards their sun to finally achieve greatness. But in a grand act of espionage, the pylons on Fal'dormem were modified to be anchors instead of conduits, causing the power of the planet to instead pull the moon into itself. 

The ensuing panic and destruction caused the complete and total annihilation of Fal'dormem, Grattum, its people, and all life on the planet as was known. The only rememnant of the planet, was The Omega, the single Diety who watched as her only followers hubris was their ultimate downfall.

# Artificer
}}
Masters of invention, artificers use ingenuity and magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in objects. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions. You can find everything you need to play one of these inventors in the next few sections.

Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist’s supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher’s supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker’s tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce the right tool for a job as well as an artificer.

## Artificers in Many Worlds
Throughout the D&D multiverse, artificers create inventions and magic items of peace and war. Many lives have been brightened or saved because of the work of kind artificers, but countless lives have also been lost because of the mass destruction unleashed by certain artificers’ creations.
\column
In the Forgotten Realms, the island of Lantan is home to many artificers, and in the world of Dragonlance, tinker gnomes are often members of this class.

The strange technologies in the Barrier Peaks of the world of Greyhawk have inspired some folk to walk the path of the artificer, and in Mystara, various nations employ artificers to keep airships and other wondrous devices operational.

Artificers in the City of Sigil share discoveries from throughout the multiverse, and from there, the gnome artificer Vi runs a cosmos-spanning business that hires adventurers to fix problems that others deem unfixable. In Vi’s home world, Eberron, magic is harnessed as a form of science and deployed throughout society, largely as a result of the wondrous ingenuity of artificers.

## Creating an Artificer
To create an artificer, consult the following subsections, which give you hit points, proficiencies, and starting equipment. Then look at the Artificer table to see which features you get at each level. The descriptions of those features appear in the “Artificer Features” section.

The secrets of gunpowder weapons have been discovered in various corners of the D&D multiverse. If your Dungeon Master uses the rules on firearms in the Dungeon Master’s Guide and your artificer has been exposed to the operation of such weapons, your artificer is proficient with them.

#### Starting Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

- any two simple weapons of your choice
- a light crossbow and 20 bolts
- your choice of studded leather armor or scale mail
- thieves’ tools and a dungeoneer’s pack

{{note
##### MULTICLASSING AND THE ARTIFICER

If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose artificer as one of your classes.

***Ability Score Minimum***. As a multiclass character, you must have at least an Intelligence score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already an artificer.

***Proficiencies Gained.*** If artificer isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as an artificer: light armor, medium armor, shields, thieves’ tools, tinker’s tools.

***Spell Slots.*** Add half your levels (rounded up) in the artificer class to the appropriate levels from other classes to determine your available spell slots.

## Class Features
As an artificer, you gain the following class features, which are summarized in the Artificer table.

### Magical Tinkering
*1st-level artificer feature*
:
You’ve learned how to invest a spark of magic into mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have thieves’ tools or artisan’s tools in hand. You then touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and give it one of the following magical properties of your choice:

- The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
- Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet away. You utter the message when you bestow this property on the object, and the recording can be no more than 6 seconds long.
- The object continuously emits your choice of an odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping, or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.
- A static visual effect appears on one of the object’s surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25 words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of these elements, as you like.

The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an action, you can touch the object and end the property early.

You can bestow magic on multiple objects, touching one object each time you use this feature, though a single object can only bear one property at a time. The maximum number of objects you can affect with this feature at one time is equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.

### Spellcasting
*1st-level artificer feature*
:
You’ve studied the workings of magic and how to cast spells, channeling the magic through objects. To observers, you don’t appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you appear to produce wonders from mundane items and outlandish inventions.

#### Tools Required
You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus—specifically thieves’ tools or some kind of artisan’s tool—in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an “M” component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See the equipment chapter in the Player’s Handbook for descriptions of these tools.
{{note
##### THE MAGIC OF ARTIFICE

As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your spells. When describing your spellcasting, think about how you’re using a tool. For example, if you cast cure wounds using alchemist’s supplies, you could be quickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker’s tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider that binds wounds. The effect of the spell is the same either way.
:
Such details don’t limit you in any way or provide you with any benefit beyond the spell’s effects. You don’t have to justify how you’re using tools to cast a spell. But describing your spellcasting creatively is a fun way to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.
}}
After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.



#### Cantrips (0-Level Spells)
You know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.

When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind magic
\page
{{pageNumber,auto}}

allows you to wield these spells with superior skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
{{text-align:center
**Spell save DC** :: = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** :: = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
}}
#### Ritual Casting
You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

#### Artificer Spell List
Here’s the list of spells you consult when you learn an artificer spell. The list is organized by spell level, not character level. If a spell can be cast as a ritual, the ritual tag appears after the spell’s name.

Each spell is in the Player’s Handbook, unless it has one asterisk (a spell in chapter 3) or two asterisks (a spell in Xanathar’s Guide to Everything).

### Infuse Item
*2nd-level artificer feature*
:
You’ve gained the ability to imbue mundane items with certain magical infusions, turning those objects into magic items.

#### Infusions Known
When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn, choosing from the “Artificer Infusions” section at the end of the class’s description. You learn additional infusions of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with a new one.

#### Infusing an Item
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as specified in the infusion’s description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see the attunement rules in the Dungeon Master’s Guide).

Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1
\page
{{pageNumber,auto}}

day). The infusion also vanishes if you replace your knowledge of the infusion.

You can infuse more than one nonmagical object at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of objects appears in the Infused Items column of the Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects, and each of your infusions can be in only one object at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion ends, and then the new infusion applies.

If an infusion ends on an item that contains other things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.

### Artificer Specialist
*3rd-level artificer feature*
:
Choose the type of specialist you are: Alchemist, Armorer, Artillerist, or Battle Smith, each of which is detailed after the class’s description. Your choice grants you features at 5th level and again at 9th and 15th level.

### The Right Tool for the Job
*3rd-level artificer feature*
:
You’ve learned how to produce exactly the tool you need: with thieves’ tools or artisan’s tools in hand, you can magically create one set of artisan’s tools in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they vanish when you use this feature again.

### Ability Score Improvement
*4th-level artificer feature*
:
When you reach 4th level and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Tool Expertise
*6th-level artificer feature*
:
Your proficiency bonus is now doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool.

### Flash of Genius
*7th-level artificer feature*
:
You’ve gained the ability to come up with solutions under pressure. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Magic Item Adept
*10th-level artificer feature*
:
You’ve achieved a profound understanding of how to use and make magic items:

You can attune to up to four magic items at once.
If you craft a magic item with a rarity of common or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the normal time, and it costs you half as much of the usual gold.

### Spell-Storing Item
*11th-level artificer feature*
:
You can now store a spell in an object. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or martial weapon or one item that you can use as a spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a 1st- or 2nd-level spell from the artificer spell list that requires 1 action to cast (you needn’t have it prepared).

While holding the object, a creature can take an action to produce the spell’s effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires concentration, the creature must concentrate. The spell stays in the object until it’s been used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this feature again to store a spell in an object.

### Magic Item Savant
*14th-level artificer feature*
:
Your skill with magic items deepens:

- You can attune to up to five magic items at once.
- You ignore all class, race, spell, and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item.
### Magic Item Master
*18th-level artificer feature*
:
You can now attune to up to six magic items at once.

### Soul of Artifice
*20th-level artificer feature*
:
You have developed a mystical connection to your magic items, which you can draw on for protection:

-You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per magic item you are currently attuned to.
- If you’re reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to end one of your artificer infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit point instead of 0.

## Artificer Specialists
Artificers pursue many disciplines. Here are specialist options you can choose from at 3rd level.

### Alchemist
An Alchemist is an expert at combining reagents to produce mystical effects. Alchemists use their creations to give life and to leech it away. Alchemy is the oldest of artificer traditions, and its versatility has long been valued during times of war and peace.

#### Tool Proficiency
*3rd-level Alchemist feature*
:
You gain proficiency with alchemist’s supplies. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan’s tools of your choice.

#### Alchemist Spells
*3rd-level Alchemist feature*
:
You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Alchemist Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don’t count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

##### Alchemist Spells
| Artificer Level | Spell                             |
|:---------------:|-----------------------------------|
|       3rd       | healing word, ray of sickness     |
|       5th       | flaming sphere, Melf’s acid arrow |
|       9th       | gaseous form, mass healing word   |
|       13th      | blight, death ward                |
|       17th      | cloudkill, raise dead             |

#### Experimental Elixir
*3rd-level Alchemist feature*
:
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can magically produce an experimental elixir in an empty flask you touch. Roll on the Experimental Elixir table for the elixir’s effect, which is triggered when someone drinks the elixir. As an action, a creature can drink the elixir or administer it to an incapacitated creature.

You can create additional experimental elixirs by expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher for each one. When you do so, you use your action to create the elixir in an empty flask you touch, and you choose the elixir’s effect from the Experimental Elixir table.

Creating an experimental elixir requires you to have alchemist supplies on your person, and any elixir you create with this feature lasts until it is drunk or until the end of your next long rest.

When you reach certain levels in this class, you can make more elixirs at the end of a long rest: two at 6th level and three at 15th level. Roll for each elixir’s effect separately. Each elixir requires its own flask.

##### Experimental Elixir
| d6 | Effect|
|:--:|:-------------------|
|  1 | **Healing**. The drinker regains a number of hit points equal to 2d4 + your Intelligence modifier.|
|  2 | **Swiftness**. The drinker’s walking speed increases by 10 feet for 1 hour.|
|  3 | **Resilience**. The drinker gains a +1 bonus to AC for 10 minutes.|
|  4 | **Boldness**. The drinker can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to every attack roll and saving throw they make for the next minute.|
|  5 | **Flight**. The drinker gains a flying speed of 10 feet for 10 minutes.|
|  6 | **Transformation**. The drinker’s body is transformed as if by the alter self spell. The drinker determines the transformation caused by the spell, the effects of which last for 10 minutes. |

#### Alchemical Savant
*5th-level Alchemist feature*
:
You’ve developed masterful command of magical chemicals, enhancing the healing and damage you create through them. Whenever you cast a spell using your alchemist’s supplies as the spellcasting focus, you gain a bonus to one roll of the spell. That roll must restore hit points or be a damage roll that deals acid, fire, necrotic, or poison damage, and the bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).

#### Restorative Reagents
*9th-level Alchemist feature*
:
You can incorporate restorative reagents into some of your works:

- Whenever a creature drinks an experimental elixir you created, the creature gains temporary hit points equal to 2d6 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point).
- You can cast lesser restoration without expending a spell slot and without preparing the spell, provided you use alchemist’s supplies as the spellcasting focus. You can do so a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Chemical Mastery
*15th-level Alchemist feature*
:
You have been exposed to so many chemicals that they pose little risk to you, and you can use them to quickly end certain ailments:

- You gain resistance to acid damage and poison damage, and you are immune to the poisoned condition.
\page
{{pageNumber,auto}}

- You can cast greater restoration and heal without expending a spell slot, without preparing the spell, and without material components, provided you use alchemist’s supplies as the spellcasting focus. Once you cast either spell with this feature, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest.

### Armorer
An artificer who specializes as an Armorer modifies armor to function almost like a second skin. The armor is enhanced to hone the artificer’s magic, unleash potent attacks, and generate a formidable defense. The artificer bonds with this armor, becoming one with it even as they experiment with it and refine its magical capabilities.

#### Tools of the Trade
*3rd-level Armorer feature*
:
You gain proficiency with heavy armor. You also gain proficiency with smith’s tools. If you already have this tool proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan’s tools of your choice.

#### Armorer Spells
*3rd-level Armorer feature*
:
You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Armorer Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don’t count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.
##### Armorer Spells
| Artificer Level | Spell                             |
|:---------------:|-----------------------------------|
|       3rd       | magic missile, thunderwave        |
|       5th       | mirror image, shatter             |
|       9th       | hypnotic pattern, lightning bolt  |
|       13th      | fire shield, greater invisibility |
|       17th      | passwall, wall of force           |

#### Arcane Armor
*3rd-level Armorer feature*
:
Your metallurgical pursuits have led to you making armor a conduit for your magic. As an action, you can turn a suit of armor you are wearing into Arcane Armor, provided you have smith’s tools in hand.

You gain the following benefits while wearing this armor:

- If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the arcane armor lacks this requirement for you.
- You can use the arcane armor as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.
- The armor attaches to you and can’t be removed against your will. It also expands to cover your entire body, although you can retract or deploy the helmet as a bonus action. The armor replaces any missing limbs, functioning identically to a limb it replaces.
- You can doff or don the armor as an action.

The armor continues to be Arcane Armor until you don another suit of armor or you die.

#### Armor Model
*3rd-level Armorer feature*
:
You can customize your Arcane Armor. When you do so, choose one of the following armor models: Guardian or Infiltrator. The model you choose gives you special benefits while you wear it.

Each model includes a special weapon. When you attack with that weapon, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, to the attack and damage rolls.

You can change the armor’s model whenever you finish a short or long rest, provided you have smith’s tools in hand.

***Guardian.*** You design your armor to be in the front line of conflict. It has the following features:
:
**Thunder Gauntlets.** Each of the armor’s gauntlets counts as a simple melee weapon while you aren’t holding anything in it, and it deals 1d8 thunder damage on a hit. A creature hit by the gauntlet has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn, as the armor magically emits a distracting pulse when the creature attacks someone else.

**Defensive Field.** As a bonus action, you can gain temporary hit points equal to your level in this class, replacing any temporary hit points you already have. You lose these temporary hit points if you doff the armor. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
:
***Infiltrator.*** You customize your armor for subtle undertakings. It has the following features:
:
**Lightning Launcher.** A gemlike node appears on one of your armored fists or on the chest (your choice). It counts as a simple ranged weapon, with a normal range of 90 feet and a long range of 300 feet, and it deals 1d6 lightning damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with it, you can deal an extra 1d6 lightning damage to that target.

**Powered Steps.** Your walking speed increases by 5 feet.

**Dampening Field.** You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on such checks, the advantage and disadvantage cancel each other, as normal.
\page
{{pageNumber,auto}}

#### Extra Attack
*5th-level Armorer feature*
:
You can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Armor Modifications
*9th-level Armorer feature*
:
You learn how to use your artificer infusions to specially modify your Arcane Armor. That armor now counts as separate items for the purposes of your Infuse Item feature: armor (the chest piece), boots, helmet, and the armor’s special weapon. Each of those items can bear one of your infusions, and the infusions transfer over if you change your armor’s model with the Armor Model feature. In addition, the maximum number of items you can infuse at once increases by 2, but those extra items must be part of your Arcane Armor.

#### Perfected Armor
*15th-level Armorer feature*
:
Your Arcane Armor gains additional benefits based on its model, as shown below.

***Guardian.*** When a Huge or smaller creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to magically force it to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, you pull the creature up to 25 feet directly to an unoccupied space. If you pull the target to a space within 5 feet of you, you can make a melee weapon attack against it as part of this reaction.

You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

***Infiltrator.*** Any creature that takes lightning damage from your Lightning Launcher glimmers with magical light until the start of your next turn. The glimmering creature sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls against you, as the light jolts it if it attacks you. In addition, the next attack roll against it has advantage, and if that attack hits, the target takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage.

### Artillerist
An Artillerist specializes in using magic to hurl energy, projectiles, and explosions on a battlefield. This destructive power is valued by armies in the wars on many different worlds. And when war passes, some members of this specialization seek to build a more peaceful world by using their powers to fight the resurgence of strife. The world-hopping gnome artificer Vi has been especially vocal about making things right: “It’s about time we fixed things instead of blowing them all to hell.”

#### Tool Proficiency
*3rd-level Artillerist feature*
:
You gain proficiency with woodcarver’s tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan’s tools of your choice.

#### Artillerist Spells
*3rd-level Artillerist feature*
:
You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Artillerist Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don’t count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.
##### Artillerist Spells
| Artificer Level | Spell                       |
|:---------------:|-----------------------------|
|       3rd       | shield, thunderwave         |
|       5th       | scorching ray, shatter      |
|       9th       | fireball, wind wall         |
|       13th      | ice storm, wall of fire     |
|       17th      | cone of cold, wall of force |

#### Eldritch Cannon
*3rd-level Artillerist feature*
:
You’ve learned how to create a magical cannon. Using woodcarver’s tools or smith’s tools, you can take an action to magically create a Small or Tiny eldritch cannon in an unoccupied space on a horizontal surface within 5 feet of you. A Small eldritch cannon occupies its space, and a Tiny one can be held in one hand.

Once you create a cannon, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot to create one. You can have only one cannon at a time and can’t create one while your cannon is present.

The cannon is a magical object. Regardless of size, the cannon has an AC of 18 and a number of hit points equal to five times your artificer level. It is immune to poison damage and psychic damage. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). If the mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 1 hour. You can dismiss it early as an action.

When you create the cannon, you determine its appearance and whether it has legs. You also decide which type it is, choosing from the options on the Eldritch Cannons table. On each of your turns, you can take a bonus action to cause the cannon to activate if you are within 60 feet of it. As part of the same bonus action, you can direct the cannon to walk or climb up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space, provided it has legs.
\page
{{pageNumber,auto}}

##### Eldritch Cannons
| Cannon         | Activation  |
|:----------------|:------------|
| Flamethrower   | The cannon exhales fire in an adjacent 15-foot cone that you designate. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried. |
| Force Ballista | Make a ranged spell attack, originating from the cannon, at one creature or object within 120 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is pushed up to 5 feet away from the cannon.  |
| Protector      | The cannon emits a burst of positive energy that grants itself and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of it a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).  |

#### Arcane Firearm
*5th-level Artillerist feature*
:
You know how to turn a wand, staff, or rod into an arcane firearm, a conduit for your destructive spells. When you finish a long rest, you can use woodcarver’s tools to carve special sigils into a wand, staff, or rod and thereby turn it into your arcane firearm. The sigils disappear from the object if you later carve them on a different item. The sigils otherwise last indefinitely.

You can use your arcane firearm as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells. When you cast an artificer spell through the firearm, roll a d8, and you gain a bonus to one of the spell’s damage rolls equal to the number rolled.

#### Explosive Cannon
*9th-level Artillerist feature*
:
Every eldritch cannon you create is now more destructive:

- The cannon’s damage rolls all increase by 1d8.
- As an action, you can command the cannon to detonate if you are within 60 feet of it. Doing so destroys the cannon and forces each creature within 20 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 3d8 force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Fortified Position
*15th-level Artillerist feature*
:
You’re a master at forming well-defended emplacements using your Eldritch Cannon:

- You and your allies have half cover while within 10 feet of a cannon you create with Eldritch Cannon, as a result of a shimmering field of magical protection that the cannon emits.
- You can now have two cannons at the same time. You can create two with the same action (but not the same spell slot), and you can activate both of them with the same bonus action. You determine whether the cannons are identical to each other or different. You can’t create a third cannon while you have two.

### Battle Smith
Armies require protection, and someone has to put things back together if defenses fail. A combination of protector and medic, a Battle Smith is an expert at defending others and repairing both materiel and personnel. To aid in their work, Battle Smiths are accompanied by a steel defender, a protective companion of their own creation. Many soldiers tell stories of nearly dying before being saved by a Battle Smith and a steel defender.

In the world of Eberron, Battle Smiths played a key role in House Cannith’s work on battle constructs and the original warforged, and after the Last War, these artificers led efforts to aid those who were injured in the war’s horrific battles.

#### Tool Proficiency
*3rd-level Battle Smith feature*
:
You gain proficiency with smith’s tools. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan’s tools of your choice.

#### Battle Smith Spells
*3rd-level Battle Smith feature*
:
You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Battle Smith Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don’t count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

##### Battle Smith Spells
| Artificer Level | Spell                             |
|:---------------:|-----------------------------------|
|       3rd       | heroism, shield                   |
|       5th       | branding smite, warding bond      |
|       9th       | aura of vitality, conjure barrage |
|       13th      | aura of purity, fire shield       |
|       17th      | banishing smite, mass cure wounds |

#### Battle Ready
*3rd-level Battle Smith feature*
:
Your combat training and your experiments with magic have paid off in two ways:
\page
{{pageNumber,auto}}

- You gain proficiency with martial weapons.
- When you attack with a magic weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity modifier, for the attack and damage rolls.

#### Steel Defender
*3rd-level Battle Smith feature*
:
Your tinkering has borne you a companion, a steel defender. It’s friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the Steel Defender stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You determine the creature’s appearance and whether it has two legs or four; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.

In combat, the defender shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the defender can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.

If the mending spell is cast on the defender, it regains 2d6 hit points. If it has died within the last hour, you can use your smith’s tools as an action to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The defender returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.

At the end of a long rest, you can create a new steel defender if you have smith’s tools with you. If you already have a defender from this feature, the first one immediately perishes. The defender also perishes if you die.

#### Extra Attack
*5th-level Battle Smith feature*
:
You can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

#### Arcane Jolt
*9th-level Battle Smith feature*
:
You’ve learned new ways to channel arcane energy to harm or heal. When either you hit a target with a magic weapon attack or your steel defender hits a target, you can channel magical energy through the strike to create one of the following effects:

- The target takes an extra 2d6 force damage.
- Choose one creature or object you can see within 30 feet of the target. Healing energy flows into the chosen recipient, restoring 2d6 hit points to it.

You can use this energy a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), but you can do so no more than once on a turn. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

# The World of Rakkten
}}
#
The large world of **Rakkten** is Eons old. From grand heroes, to infamous villains, the world has seeen itself torn asunder and rebuilt again and again. Though conflict is ripe within the Lands of Rakkten, it's primary continent **Fal'Doren** is seemingly a bastion of hope amongst its denizens. Heroes have arisen from all walks of life, trained and untrained in the hopes of extingushing any whisper of evil from the lands.
<!--
While life has been relatively peaceful the last 1000 years, much has changed. Gods have risen to power, the world was forever changed, and rumors of a greater threat have emergered from the far reaches of the land. Before you can venture forth into this uncertain world, you must know of it's rich history and promise.
-->
The History of Fal'doren can be broken up into 3 distinct eras in the past Millennia: **The Emergence**, **The Plaguewinds**, and **The Fracture**. Currently, the land is in a new era, known only as the P.F. Era, or **Post-Fracture Era.**

## The Emergence
<!-- - The Time of prosperous growth for the many races of the world. Humans, Elves, Dwarves all rose in power together to help foster the modern civilization we have today. Other races soon followed, and it was a time of true peace.
  - Large cities began to be built, and **Atlas** Began Construction-->
  
A little over a thousand years ago, Humans, Dwarves, and Elves took it upon themselves to refine what is now known as our modern civilization. All three Major Races played a part in forging Fal'Doren into the continent it is today, with it's massive cities, beautiful landscapes, and rich history.

In 15 E.E. or "**Emergence Era**", Humans founded their first home; **Farendell**, a modest but relatively large city that was founded primarily as a fishing and agriculture center. It served as a stepping stone for other human clans to expand eastward and southward across what would later be called *The Lands Abound*. Over the following decades, they would create smaller settlements and as they began to reach the mountainous region of **The Shard Spires,** they found their first ally.

Elves are one of the oldest races on Rakkten, and the only that can sustain an extremely elongated lifespan. In 31 E.E. Humanity happened upon the great Elvish Captial of **Solstice**. A massive and intricate architecture of a city built within the trees of a great forest. The Elves were true masters of their craft, from their weaponry, to their homes, Elves found a way to prefer form over function, yet keep so much resiliency.

Dwarves on the other hand have kept their hardy nature in nearly everything they do. Originally living deep within the Mountains of the Shard Spires, the Dwarven clans united as a single front in 40 E.E. and have since been the pinacle of united civilization. While the Humans consistently war and disagree with one another; Elves being seperated by Class, House, and Nobility; Dwarves have combined their strengths to compliment each others weaknesses.

Eventually, Dwarves realized that the rest of the world would be fools to not put their differnces aside to join as one. As such, they invited Elves and Humans alike to join in the creation of the greatest test of a civilizaiton: A Single Capital of Fal'Doren. The Humans decided it would be called **Atlas**, the Common word for a large tome containing maps of a larger region. They believed it would be appropriate, stating that all others from across the lands would flock to the City. The Dwarves would utilize their mastercrafters in masonry to craft the halls of the city within the depths of the Shard Spires, and the Elves would provide their intricate designs to the courtyard and infrastructure of the city weaving beauty with functionality.

This unlikely union of peoples lead to one of the largest projects to ever be conceived, taking place over hundreds of years, with the "Official" end of the construction of Atlas taking place in 592 E.E. The city, however is still maintained and expanded upon in Modern Times regularly.
## The Plaguewinds
<!-- Drak'iseth -->
As the peaceful unity of Races continued in Fal'Doren, dark forces were beginning to form their own unified front. In the Year 694 E.E. a Black-Dragonborn Wizard, Drak'iseth, rose to power in an attempt to usurp the lands from the conjoined empire of Humans, Elves, and Dwarves. His dark magic brought about great Plagues and harsh unnatural storms that ravaged the lands. Soon after his rise, forests burned, oceans overflowed, mountains began to crumble. The peoples of the world were seperated, unity being a commodity of the past. All kingdoms began to fend for themsleves, not providing aid to one another, in an attempt to keep their own denizens alive. No lone groups of heroes could seemingly defeat his armies or onslaught, with any attempts swiftly cut down. With little hope remaining, a small band of heroes concocted a plan designed to decimate Drak'iseth, **<u>a death curse</u>**.

This death curse would sunder Drak'iseth's body, but not his soul. Although this troupe seemingly succeeded in their endevour, Drak'iseth manifested all of his remaining power to transfer his soul into one of his willing soldiers. This process was not fulproof though, with his body restored, his soul remained fractured; his mind seemingly undone. Drak'iseth's mind would warp and twist, making his misery he inflicted on others more vile and grotesque. Eventually he turned to murdering his own followers, and raising their mutilated corpses into mindless servants of undeath.

For the next five years, Drak'iseth's malefic regin grew. From targeted attacks on major cities, to bands of heroes being turned into his personal undead kill squads, there seemed to be nothing that could defeat even his lowest thralls. The world was at his mercy, and Drak'iseth was anything but merciful. However, in 700 E.E One Hero attempted to do what no other could: **<u>destroy the soul of Drak'iseth.</u>**

{{note
### Lonard Brakksben
Lonard Brakksben was a hero in his own right. Being the leader of the famed ***Thundersteps***, Lonard was a warrior of the Wilds like no other. Weilding a Longsword and Battle axe together, Lonard was one of the only known warriors to weild such weapons in tandem.

With his weapons **Lightning** and **Thunder**, Lonard procceded to assualt the armies of Drak'iseth firsthand. Starting his assault within the Jasper Wilds, Lonard cut down nearly any foe he came across. It was only a month into his retaliation against Drak'iseth that he made his way into the massive **Tarrleyan Forests**, where he began to ally himself with the druidic peoples of the foresets. With his own personal army aligned within the forces of nature, the druids rallied behind Lonard in an effort to cease the affront to the natural cycle of life and death.
:
Finally, it would be an ultimate assault against the forces of true evil. Within the reaches of the Shard Spires, Drak'iseth waited with his armies of the undead. The conflict would eventually erupt at the meeting point between the northern border of the Tarrleyan Forests and the southern border of the Shard Spires. The battle was unlike any other that had accured in history; Hundreds of Thousands perished in the conflict, with bodies forming mountains of flesh, and rivers of blood.

Standing above them however, were two entities engaged in seemingly endless combat, Lonard and Drak'iseth. Reports of the engagment were varied and unconfirmed, but rumors of a weeks-long endless frenzy was a commonality. Lonard struck with Lightning and Thunder, streaks of electricity slaying any foes who would stray too close, and booming waves of thunderous force flinging the perished away with ease.
:
Eventually, in a final effort to end the chaos, Lonard shouted to the heavens, beseeching the Gods to grant him the power to save the Lands and its people. Raising both his Greatsword and Greataxe above, he himself was struck by a single bolt of lightning and became empowered with the might of the storm. With this new found power, he began to overpower Drak'iseth, eventually forcing them both to succumb to the new strength he had been given.

The power of the Gods proved to be too much for Lonard's Mortal body to contain. As such, in his final strike against Drak'iseth, he too fell. But as Lonard fell the heavenes themselves opened, and granted Lonard's Soul a second chance: The chance to become one of them. Lonard would no longer be the mortal hero of Fal'Doren, but instead become **The Lord of Storms.**
}}

As Drak'iseths soul and life essence faded away, so too did his armies cease to exist. The corpses of the damned returned to the earth swiftly, leaving little left of the battles except for the living who had given their lives for the protection of the lands. After the long counting of the dead, the factions and kingdoms of the world agreed that the body of Lonard was to be preserved and buried in his final resting place, known today as **Lonard's Stand**.

## The Fracture
With the armies of Drak'iseth defeated, and a new Prime Diety secured into the patheon, the Lands of Fal'Doren began to flurish once again. For nearly two and a half centuries, peace filled the land. Temples and holy structures to Lonard began to take shape, and Cities across the Lands began to form new societies and factions of their own. 

At the forefront of one of those societies was a powerful Archmage, **Alistair Stormweaver**. In the year 885 E.E. Using his expertise in the arcane, he constructed a large Citadel deep in the forests of **The Wendaren Wilds** to house Adventureres from all paths of life. While Alistair himself was primarily a follower of The Lord of Storms, he wanted to create a bastiton for all Adventurers to flock to. His **Arcane Citadel** would become a massive enterprise, filling the Lands of Fal'Doren with highly trained and competent heroes. Alistair believed the world required a dedicated and good-aligned force to snuff out any forces of evil before they could  amass the type of power Drak'iseth had.

To his credit, Alistair's "experiment" worked. The Arcane Citadel produced some of the greatest heroes known in the Lands, and evil seemed to be put to rest very publicly in all parts of the world. Towns, Cities, and even Captials began to plainly show off iconography of the Citadel and its "**Arcanites**" in an attempt to show them safe haven, and as a warning to any would-be evildoers.

However, Alistair couldn't account for everything. For 115 years, the Citadel helped to protect the world from any threat that cames it way, but the greatest threat of all could never have been stopped. In what was supposed to be the "coming of a new age" in the year 1000 E.E the world changed forever.

The event know as **The Fracture** was one of unparalleled disaster. Historians recount it with poetic masochism; Scientists recount it as impossible; Religous Alcolytes recount it as a reckoning; But Adventurers, Adventurers recount it for what it was.
:
{{font-size:25px,font-family:MrEavesRemake **Disaster**}}
:
Records of what occured are vast and convoluted. The only certainties came in the massive changes in landscape. The **Tarrleyan Forests** vanished in the blink of an eye, leaving only desert landscapes as far as the eyecould see. The Northern Shard Spires crumbled and fell, blocking off the only access to the Ter'ak Sea from the Westward Shores, creating what would be known as **Horizon's Shadow**. In the Northlands, the Black Forest became cursed with Darkfae Creatures, morphing the forest into **The Blackwald**. Even the famous Human capital of **Farendell** saw pieces of its City disappear and other be replaced with impossible things. 
:
Finally, in the year 35 P.F. the world is vastly different...

# The Northlands     
{{pageNumber,auto}}


### Northpass
The Northpass is a wild untamed land in the furthest reaches of **The Northlands.** Home to Savages, Dragons, and other rumored monsters, it's a region of desolation. Many adventurers through the years have spent countless weeks attempting to map the region, only to return speaking on the folly of passing the Northern Mountain ranges. It is said passing the mountains are nearly, if not completely, impossible and any who seek to do so, only want for death.

It is not uncommon for many to believe in these rumors and try nonetheless, however, only a few have braves the terrors and ruthless battles the Northpass has to offer. Upon the World Map, Northpass lies within the deep reaches of the Northern Mountains, slightly dripping into the Westward forests of the Wendaren Wilds.

This land is not for the faint of heart. You will find no civilization, no respite, and no saftey in Northpass for any adventurers; Arcinite or Wanderer alike.
### The Blackwald

A Dense forest full of wildlife and fauna of both The Material Plane, and the Feywild. A mixture of dangerous and friendly creatures walk these lands, ripe for adventure and curiosity. Deep within the forest lies a clearing, that when viewed under the light of a full moon, one can see a series of druidic symbols making a circle around rapidly growing wolfsbane. Should any shape-changer or lycanthrope change states in this circle they may be cured of their ailment, or trapped forever; So the legends say... 
{{note
To the south lies a small hut built within a large Oak Tree. There lies the Feline Shifter Grimaia, or Grim for short. She sells a variety of magical items, scrolls, and custom healing potions (Made to order). She is more interested in the people who visit her shop and their adventures, than making any coin from them. Common is her second language so she speaks with a unique candor and takes unnatural pauses, almost trying to find the correct word, often. Although she is mainly posted to the south of The Blackwald, she can be found in any major city that has a nature district. She is fond of returning customers, especially if they have more interesting stories to tell.

<!-- Firemorn Town Info -->
### Firemorn
Although many adventurers pass through the small town of Firemorn, it has, through infamy or otherwise, become the defacto "Beginners Town." 

Dubbed as such by veteran Adventurers, they believe that the nearby Arcane Citadel allows many such goings-on to occur to help "train" their new Arcanite Recruits, and let any Wanderers test their might.

Although the townsfolk don't seem to mind the monthly kidnapping, or goblin attack, many believe there is something more going on...
#### **Population:** 
**Town:** 2769 (70% Humans, 18% Halflings, 7% Elves, 5% Other Races)
#### **Government:** 

The small town is governed by an appointed Mayor, whom reports to the “Keeper” of Storms Helm.

#### **Defense:** 
The city has little defense in the form of a citizen militia and volunteer warriors.

#### **Commerce:** 
Firemorn exports its agriculture throughout the surrounding areas, but mostly to Storms Helm.

<!-- The Blackwald Journey to Storm's Helm. Learned via rumors and piecemeal information -->
### Torm
Not much is known of the small island fishing village of Torm. Many visitors have called the town quaint and inviting. For adventurers, Torm is a relieving rest stop on the high seas before truly venturing into the unknown of the Northern Seas, or returning to the saftey of Storm's Helm.
#### **Population:** 
**Town:** ~950(60% Humans, 15% Halflings, 10% Gnomes, 10% Dwarves, 5% Other Races)
#### **Government:** 

The small town is governed by an elected Mayor, who bargins trade routes to Durax Keep and Storm's Helm.

#### **Defense:** 
The city has little defense in the form of a citizen militia and volunteer warriors.

#### **Commerce:** 
Torm exports its agriculture, fish, and unique delicacies through water-bound trade routes to the stronghold of Durax Keep, and their personal dock in Storm's Helm.

\page
### The Wendaren Wilds
The untamed wilds to the west and south of **Storm's Helm** are some of the most uninhabited lands acorss Fal'doren, and especially the Northlands. Many beasts, monsters, and nefarious factions find there home in these blanketed flat lands, forests, and mountain ranges.
:
Save for the might of **The Arcane Citadel**, no other sect of civilization has made it's mark within **The Wendaren Wilds**, marking it as the perfect testing bed for all up and coming adventuring types.
:
For the last few years, some recent adevnturing types have laid claim to some rumors that a small group of nomads have made small homes deep within the wilds, but no one has been able to verify these claims as of late. The only verifiable piece of knowledge is that of a "Wandering Merchant" who makes their home within large ***Ancients**,* massive trees that are nearly 500 years of age or more. It is said these trees originated from the **Faewild**, and were brought over with the events of **The Fracture,** but such accounts have been unproven.
### Durax Keep

#### **Population:**
**Stronghold:** ~200(35% Humans, 35% Elves, 15% Gnomes, 10% Dwarves, 5% Other Races)

#### **Government:**

Durax Keep reports to both Storm's Helm and Farendell of its location security.

#### **Defense:**
Durax Keep is heavily fortified with a metal-reinforced log wall, guard towers, and a singular double door entrance. A Large force of various military personel are stationed at the Stronghold.

# The Lands Abound
::
### The Wender Marshlands

A sprawling assortment of waterways, muddy paths, and aquatic beasts of all sorts have claimed this land as their own. Acting as one of the only passages to and from **The Northlands**, The Wender Marshlands act as a natural barrier to any outsiders. This, in turn, makes the guard trade highly lucrative to any would-be adventurers hoping to expand their reach via assisting Traders crossing the Marshlands.

Throughout the Marshlands lie many folk-tales and rumors of various druidic cirlces and tribesfolk. Though many of these rumors have been unconfirmed, many still take caution when traveling through the Wender Marshlands, for none truely know what lurks in the muck...

### Farendell
The tight knit city of Farendell holds many different walks of life in its walls. **"The Glory Hole,"** as it is so unsavorously named, is the Cities premiere fighting ring and primary form of commernce. Any and all travelers beyond and within the walls may fight for "Gold and Glory," but the real intrigue is the city life outside of the ring. Bustling trade districts and gulidhalls make an honest living within the city, waiting for those to browse their wares.

#### **Population:** 
**City:** ~72,000 (35% Humans, 25% Elves, 20% Dwarves, 15% Half-Races, 5% Other Races)
#### **Government:** 

This Large City is governed by an appointed "Herald." Residents know this leader as only a figurehead, as crime seems to run rampant in the city, and the various theives guilds "run" the city.

#### **Defense:** 
The city has a large defensive force in the form of: City Watch, Sea-facing artillery, and Capital Punishment for crime.

#### **Commerce:** 
Farendell is a gamblers delight. Much of the commerce generated by the city lies within the fighting pit. Tourists and Residents alike can bet for or against fighers and the "city" takes a cut off the top of the total winnings.

### The Burnwood
Nearly thirty years ago **The Fracture** introducted many changes to the natural order of the world. One of the more notable ones, was **The Burnwood**, a northern forest of The Lands Abound, changed by an ancient Fae Curse. The *Solstice Curse* forced the land to be put into a perptual autumn, with many of the wildlife changing accordingly. 

Most native creatures fled the Burnwood, with new Fae denizens taking their place. Where the Blackwald houses the dark forces of the Fae, the Burnwood in turn houses the more mischievous and mild Fae Folk. With the main path leading away from Farendell flowing through the Burnwood, many travelers and adventurers alike prefer this "scenic" route through the Lands. While the main road proves safe for many, venturing off the beaten path may lead to memorable encounters of all sort.

### The Scorched Scar
Although **The Burnwood** may prove safe for many travelers, all must pass through **The Scorched Scar**, a barren land that streches through the Burnwood all the way to **The Ashen Forest**. Only a few short years following The Fracture, an undead dragon infused with Fae, Shadowfell, and Dark Magic rose within the south of the Burnwood; **A Necrodrake**. 

This Necrodrake's flame cauterized the life force of the land it touched, ceasing all ability to thrive, and raising any life it took. All along the Scar, undead now walk and kill all living things. Only the main road holds some small safety, as guardsmen and fame seekers drift along the road to protect the commonfolk, and passing adventurers. 

It was only 5 years ago, a brave band of adventureres rose up to defeat the Necrodrake, ultimately sacraficing their lives to pull it from the sky and destroy it once and for all. But, as the force behind the Necrodrake's undeath wavered and ultimately extingushed, its remains tainted the land it was felled in. Eventually, it's unholy remains created the desecrated land known as **The Ashen Forest**

### The Ashen Forest
This decrepid wasteland is barren of all life. Infested with the plague of undeath and void of all living flora and fauna, **The Ashen Forest** is one of the most deadly places on the planet. Countless citizens, adventuerers, and curious historians have perished in its lands with no hope of escaping it's grasp. Nestled deep within the forst are the remains of the **Necrodrake,** a twisted creature emanating undeath from it's decaying corpse.
:
Rumors of dark mages and untold evils have begun to spring up in recent years. Whispers of shrouded figures seemingly searching for this forbidden relic of the past have come to many who travel the path near the forest. No one seems to know the reason for these figures' search, but many can suspect it is not for a righteous cause.
:
A small sect of Death Priests and Necromancers of **Chemosh** reside within the Forest, attempting to keep its undead denizens at bay from encroaching on the lands of the living. Through their efforts, fledgling adventurers are able to cross the scar unharmed, trade routes have been resecured, and some semblance of peace has been brought back to the **Burnwood** and the **Jasper Wilds**.


{{note
#### The Lakewood
To the East of the **Burnwood**, past the **Ashen Forest**, lies the mystical **Lakewood**. Home to many of the orphaned **Miristarian Druids**, the Lakewood holds a large sect of druid clans. This mystical forest gets it unique name from the "Lake-like" island filled with trees grown by an unknown druid. The only known identifier of these trees are an ancient signature in druidic carved on to nearly every tree.
}}
### Jasper Wilds
The rolling hills and grasslands of the **Jasper Wilds** are home to all different sorts of inhabitants. From hidden hovels filled with gnomes and halflings, to the traveling village nomads of Orcs, the Wilds offer many different cultures and new faces to meet. One of the largest unbroken prairies in the land, the Wilds are truly a holy land to many Druid Circles and enthusiatsts of nature, many of whom wish to share the beauty and knowledge of the land around them. While most adventurers won't find maidens to save, or beast to slay, there is still so much history felt within the very blades of grass that sway beneath every footfall.

### Port Toela
As one of the major distributers in Fal'Doren for fish, farm, and livestock, **Port Toela** is well known as the home of the **Guild Bearers.** This faction deals heavily in Commerce, Manufacturing, and Distribution, making Port Toela the perfect outsourcing location.

Throughout the Lands Port Toela is known for it's unique City Scape, as it runs deeper inland than any other Port city. While the typical city runs along about a mile or two inland, Port Toela boasts a massive 15 mile stretch of land that consists of smaller hovels, farms, and livestock storages. While these small "Towns" don't necissarily have names, many of the people are happy to call themselves citizens of Port Toela.

#### **Population:** 
**City:** ~95,000 (35% Humans, 30% Genasi, 15% Halflings, 15% Gnomes, 10% Other Races)

#### **Government:** 
Like many Port Cities, an "Admiral" sits as the primary governing force for the city. Uniquely, this Admiral is actually democratically appointed via a majority vote every Fall and Spring Season

#### **Defense:** 
Large watch towers and guard patrols protect the inland interests. Large City walls, a City Watch, and Sea facing Cannons protect the city from any threats of assault.

#### **Commerce:** 
While Port Toela is primarily a navel shipper, it owns land as far as 15 miles inland. This land is stocked with vineyards, agricultural farms, and livestock storages. Port Toela is one of, if not *the* most profitable city in the Lands.

# The Lands Afar
:
### Terris
Many adventurers pass through the small town of Terris, but having one of the largetst outputs of novice adventurers, it's rare to see verteran adventurers make their way back.

The neighboring Metropolis of **Solstice** provides a constant outflux of new Wanderers to make their way into the larger world. While Terris is on the bigger size of Towns, it still has its own unique intrigue for the new to adventuring types.
#### **Population:** 
**Town:** ~7300 (45% Humans, 30% Elves, 15% Dwarves, 10% Other Races [Mostly Halflings, Tieflings, and Genasi])
#### **Government:** 

The town is governed by an elected Mayor.

#### **Defense:** 
The city has a moderate defense in the form of a Elven Guardsmen and multiple Watch Towers

#### **Commerce:** 
Terris exports its fishing hauls and small agriculture to Solstice and to other port cities, like Storm's Helm

### The Shard Spires
As the ancestral home of the Dwarven Clans of Fal'Doren, the **Shard Spires** are a colossal range of mountains that span miles of land further than most can see. While the Dwarven clans made their home deep in the caverns of the mountains centuries ago, the Capital **Atlas** is a major monument to all denizens of the world set in the southern base of the range. 

To the Southwest, the location of the famed **"Lord of Storm's Final Stand** can be found. As such, the Shard Spires boast a large amount of tourist and religious visitations. Although the path to "the Stand" is a relatively easy path, once arrived, many find it difficult to not be overwhelmed with the great presence that persists there.

### Lonard's Stand
A Large Stone Arch was erected in the place of death as a monument to one of the greatest mortal heroes of the realm. While Lonard only recently became a god, this monument is considered to be the first true holy site of the Fourth Prime Diety. When approaching the monument, many emotions course through the body of all who choose to make the journey.

Conflicting reports upon visiting the Stand have be said to bring about feelings of Hope, Sadness, Respect; others have said it makes them feel Weak, Small, and Introspective. 

{{note
*"To stand on the same ground a God walked... it feels mystical in it's own right. But to see the ground, the grooves in the earth, to know the a battle took place here and the earth itself still is reeling... that feels more powerful and real than any religious painting or statue.*

-- The words of a Traveler

### Tarrel Desert

Once the beautiful sprawling **Tarrleyan Forests**, The Tarrel Desert is one of the greatest changes brought about by The Fracture. A truly empty place, the Desert has no discernible landmarks, only rolling dunes as far as the eye can see. In the Southwest of the Desert, the Salen Oasis is the only form of respite from the swealtering sands.

Over the years, many people have sought answers to the question of where the Forests went, but no answers have been found. Expeditions have been made to create excavation sites, in search of what lies below the sands, but reports have confirmed that nothing lies below 25 feet of sand. These reports don't mean metaphorically, they mean literally nothing; Once a hole is dug exactly 25 feet deep, a black hole opens in the sands and swallows anyone unlucky enough to be nearby, the surrounding sands refilling the hole within the next few minutes.

Roaming bands of Bandits, Wardens, and Pirates ward off would be treasure hunters and archeologists. They consider their methods a mercy, even if violent. Pain is a powerful deterrent...

### The Slab

A barren, desolate white sheet. The Slab is a tundra with no life and seemingly no entrance or path into its waste. Before the Fracture, the Slab was nearly unreachable, boasting a sheer cliff face directly into the Western Straight nearly 100 meters tall before solidifing into ice and sleet. Now, Horizon's Shadow allows a path to the Slab for the first time.

First reports confirmed general suspicions of The Slab: a frozen waste with mountians of ice, hidden valleys beneath massive pockets of snow, and crevasses stretching hundreds of feet deep. It it highly reccommended to not venture into the Slab without proper equipment or guides, it seems like there is no reason to adventure this far north...

### Horizon's Shadow

Heading Northward past the **Shard Spires**, Horizon's Shadow only exists in part due to **The Fracture.** Although recently mapped, Horizon's Shadow was once the highest peaks of the Spires, but now turned into a ruinous rocky mass. It serves as a cobbled pathway to **The Slab,** the northern most ice slate that reaches the main continent of Fal'Doren.

Horizon's Shadow has also made its infamy through the inadvertent destruction of the **Western Straight,** a critical trade shipping route through crossing between the Ter'ak Sea and The Western Shores. After the events of the Fracture, many societies to the west suffered as a result. The solution to this new found conundrum was to create new land routes until a suitable sea route could be reestablished.

As of today, not many creatures or denizens make their homes within the Shadow, causing it to hold the same desolate nature as the Slab. Recently treasure hunters, relic collectors, and historians alike have begun to make expiditions to the Shadow in the hopes of finding any uncovered mysteries since the shifting of the mountains. Others have used this new found path to make way for the Slab and see what it might have to offer the world.

# Storm's Helm
As the Northlands Primary Port and Trade city, Storm's Helm acts as the main form of commerce for the region, and the Quest Hub for Adventureres of all experince levels. Arcanites and Wanderers alike can find plenty of guildhalls and factions within the city proper should they wish to explore it.

#### **Population:** 
**Metropolis:** ~275,000 (40% Humans, 30% Halflings, 15% Various Genasi, 10% Dwarves, 5% Other Races)
#### **Government:** 

The Sprawling metropolis is governed by a council of Elders, named Admirals. Due to the closeness of the sea and its massive sea trading commerce, the people and government of Storms Helm saw it fit to name its high ranking officials with such titles

<!-- Solstice Metropolis Info -->
# Solstice
Nobility and Regality are prominent in the Major Elf Metroplois of Solstice. While all denizes have convened under a single Royal Family, many other small houses and Lordships have formed with little scrutiny. Solstice is a beacon of nature, combined civilized architechture whilst allowing the natural growth of flora to be seemlessly intergrated into its buildings. Many Druids revere Solstice for natural practices and looks, while residents appreciate the natural beauty of the city during all seasons.
#### **Population:** 
**Metropolis:** ~450,000 (85% Elves, 10% Humans, 5% Other Races)
#### **Government:** 

Solstice is Governed by a single Royal Elven Family: The **Solmeneres** (Sol-Men-ear-s). This Royal family has 4 lower houses that it allows to bring forth policies and speak for the citizens they rule over: **The Kul'rakks**, **The Mer'rians**, **The Moonbryns**, and **The Cilrapts**.

#### **Defense:** 
The City is deep within a forest that lies to the West of **Horizon's Shadow**. Normal travel to the city is extremely difficult without direction. If direction is obtained, the City has moderately enforced iron barred walls, with a heavily fortified guard regimen.

#### **Commerce:** 
Traders and Crafters utilizing the Fauna and Flora of the surrounding area allow Solstice is function in its day to day operations, but a majority of its commerce comes from a trade route secured with Terris and Atlas. Utilizing a secret path, Solstice easily became a middleman for both cities and has since become extensively wealthy as a result.

# Salen Oasis
In the deep south of the Tarrel Desert, the Salen Oasis is the only form of respite and civilization in the endless heat and rolling dunes. While many travelers make the pilgramage from **Port Toela** through the **Jasper Wilds**, most deniznes of the Oasis actually reside within the Sands themselves.
:
Most travelers to the Oasis come for the fabled stories of the Origins of the mythical "Miristar," the ancient (and now dead) secret order of Druids and Covert Operatives. While not much is known of their exploits, the Oasis is the prime source of information as many relics of the Tarrleyan Forests were saved and brought to the Oasis after ***The Fracture.*** 
#### **Population:** 
**Metropolis:** ~175,000 <!-- ~1.5 M -->(40% Various Genasi, 30% Humans, 15% Dragonborn, 10% Tieflings,5% Other Races)
#### **Government:** 

Small Government regins supreme in the Salen Oasis. Trade Princes, Water Barons, and Various Warlords all "vie" for control of the Oasis. The many factions within the Oasis have created some form of a hierarchy for leadership, but the citizens can never figure out who is at the top. 
{{note
All of these Governing bodies secretly work together to protect the secret city beneath the sands. The war is for show, as all of the "Deaths" are either faked or pre-planned with individuals with terminal illnesses or with criminals who have been coerced or dominiated to their demise.
}}
#### **Defense:** 
The City is not fortified, nor guarded very well. Many petty crime is harshly punished by the many gangs and factions roaming the streets, enacting an old sort of "Wild West" Lawlessness.
#### **Commerce:** 
While crime is scarce within the Oasis, traders, gypsies, and crafters find their mark on the commonfolk. Local business is the leader in commerce for the Oasis, and imported contraband is highly valuable.

# The Sanctum Eternum
Below the Salen Oasis is the true nature of the Tarrel Desert. A vast and unimaginabily large cavern made of ***Adamantine Glass*** a seemingly constructed alloy of Obsidian and Adamantine that holds up the sands above it. The True City below the Salen Oasis is home to many of the Monsterous Races of Rakktenn, and holds many of the secrets of how both the Tarrel desert came to be, and the deep histories of the Planet itself.

#### **Population**
**Mega City:** 1.5M Residents (%80 various races listed in the "Banned" Section, 20% Various races across Rakkten)

#### **Government**

The Government of **The Santum Eternum** is a small joining of leadership that works together with the boides in the Oasis to help keep the secret of this Mega city. Many of the Governing bodies along with its denizens are historians and archeologist that are looking for answers into the world and what secrets it holds.

#### **Defense:**
**The Sanctum Eternum** largely has no defenses, as the secret nature of its exsistance protect it from any neerdowells. Largely, the sand/sandstone ceiling protect it from outside incursions, sucking down any treasure hunters to a nearly 500 foot demise.

#### **Commerce:**
Commerce within **The Santum Eternum** is vast: Traders, Crafters, and Fungi farmers make up most of the money makes. Some antiquities dealers or historians are subsidised by the government for reasearch purposes.

# What Are Adventurers?
:
As heroes of old, Adventurers are the lifeblood of Fal'Doren. As Protectors of the Realm, Adventurers are considered to be the greatest front of the forces of Good. Plenty of Adventurers make their start in Taverns, Mercenary employ, or even just being in the right place at the right time to prove their heroics.

Although Adventurers may belong to a large swath of organizations, kingdoms, or factions, the Lands of Fal'Doren have taken to categorizing Adventurers into two different sub-sets: **Wanderers**, those who have gotten their start in the world by venturing into the Wilds and becoming bastions of hope; and **Arcanites**, those who have devoted themselves to the famous Arcane Citadel, an Adventuring academy that acts as the largest Adventuring Guild in Fal'Doren.

### The Wanderers
Heroes known as **Wanderers** are those who have chosen the path of old. Classic Adventuring types who met by happenstance and decided to charge forth into the unknown together with allies and friends they have made along the way. Many old storied tales of Adventurers were actually Wanderers themselves, marking Wanderers as the "true" adventurers in some circles.

### The Arcanites
**Arcanites** however, are the opposite side of such a coin. With the backing and resources of **The Arcane Citadel**, Arcanites have many advantages to assist them in their travels. The world views Arcanites as Trained heroes, those willing to put in the time and effort to avoid any unwanted mishaps and mistakes. To this end, many see Wanderers as sufficient adventurers, but may be more inclined to take the curated nature of an Arcanite.

No matter where you go in the world, an Arcanite can be sought and found. Job Boards and Quest Hubs alike seek them out due to their reknown and fame related to their Patron **Alistair Stormweaver**.
:
In Adventuring circles, Wanderers and Arcanites alike have a rivalry with one another similar to that of fighting siblings. Both understand their worth in the world, yet refuse to agree on who is ahead, and who is behind.

# Heroes of Old
**Heroes of Old** are adventuring parties all throughout the Lands of Fal'Doren that have gained their noteriety through many different means. They regularly traverse the Lands seeking to change the world around them in one way or another. Should you ever find yourself in the company of such Heroes, take full advantage and create memories with some of the greatest Fal'Doren has to offer.

While some Heroes of Old are true Parties, others are considered a Classification of Heroes, such as the famed **Veteran Novices.** These heroes make it their mission to foster the fledgling adventures in towns like Firemorn or Terris, choosing to forgo their full potential in exchange for making a lasting difference in the lives of other adventurers.

Below you will see the descriptions of various Heroes of Old:
## Gintooth Deliveries
*Created by Drew Costello*

### Description

- Karl Gintooth
- Johanes Gintooth
- Werner Gintooth
- Petter Gintooth
- Ingvar Gintooth

### Claim to Fame
They really gained their fame when during a delivery, they helped a local farm stave off a goblin raid. For a whole week, these 5 dwarven heroes kept waves of goblins from burning down the buildings that they were sheltering in with a family of halflings.

 On the 5th night, Karl himself managed to sneak past the goblins keeping watch over the farm and ran 2 hours to the nearest town to muster a militia to take back the farm. In the morning, he returned with 75 men to break the encampment and liberate the farmers.
 
 The brothers were hailed as heroes! This also marks one of the few times that they had failed to deliver a shipment, but they have long since made back the money for the lost shipment in gifts and free drinks. 
### Major Accomplishments
They started their adventures as basic couriers, delivering carts of goods and sundries. They are know to be some of the best, most reliable and trustworthy couriers in the land.  They have a nearly perfect delivery record, and they have been at it for over 30 years.

They travel along established paths, only straying when a delivery or pick up requires it. Their cart has a stylized toothy grin with lips painted on it in bright colors. It is usually pulled by an mule that the brothers have affectionately named Herlig (dwarven for beautiful).

The brothers still primarily work as couriers, but they will always step up if someone is in danger.
### The Gintooth Route
The Gintooth route is the famous route the brothers take from the deepest reaches of the Lands Afar, starting at Mirist Respite, and travelling as far west as Farendell and Port Toela! Should you encounter the brothers on their route, feel free to share up to date information on the road ahead! If you're lucky enough to find them resting at one of their stops, buy them an ale as a token of appreciation.

Located in any prominent city or town, the guild's many headquarters stand as an iconic landmark, recognizable by its prominent banners and symbol that signify a safe haven for those seeking challenges, camaraderie, and training.


Built in the year 885 E.E., Aspiring adventurers from various walks of life flocked to The Arcane Citadel, drawn by the opportunity to hone their skills and gain knowledge under the tutelage of experienced mentors and seasoned adventurers. In Modern Times, the guild offers a wide range of training facilities, including combat arenas, spellcasting chambers, archery ranges, trap-laden dungeons for rogue training, and more, catering to the diverse needs of different classes.

{{descriptive
##### At the helm of The Arcane Citadel
Alistair Stormweaver, a legendary figure renowned for his expertise in combat, magic, and wisdom. As the guildmaster, he oversees the operations and ensures that every member receives equal opportunities to grow and excel as adventurers.
}}

The guild’s reputation is not solely based on Alistair’s prominence but rather on the countless adventurers who have risen to fame and accomplished great deeds after receiving training within its walls. This legacy has made The Arcane Citadel a prestigious organization that attracts the attention of quest-givers, nobles, and those in need of heroic aid. Inside The Arcane Citadel, members can find camaraderie with fellow adventurers, access valuable resources, seek guidance from mentors, and embark on missions dispatched by the guild. Beyond the halls of training, the guild also houses a vast archive of ancient maps, artifacts, and lore, which provide leads for potential quests and exciting adventures.

The Arcane Citadel becomes a central hub for Adventurers, offering them a plethora of opportunities to grow, learn, and prove themselves in the ever-changing world of Fal'Doren. From battles and quests to friendships and rivalries, this guild sets the stage for countless thrilling adventures.

## Academy Perks
With the Arcane Citadel as your group’s patron, you gain the following perks. The Citadel pays for the work you do on its behalf. The nature of your employment influences your compensation. On average, the Citadel pays each member of your group 1 gp per day, or enough to sustain a modest lifestyle. Alternatively, you receive a bounty (at least 250 gp) for each artifact or relevant discovery you bring back from your adventures and donate to the Citadel's Archives.

#### Accommodations.
You can stay at your organization’s guildhall. The rooms are comparable to those in a comfortable inn, but at a modest price (5 sp per day). Splayed throughout the continent are “safe-housing” areas within towns, cities, and metropolises that can be discerned by the Guild Symbol/Phrase (**A Black Crystal Wand with a Blue Circle Background or “Sil’me tu Rak’me Peno Fal’dormo”**)


#### Equipment
You can requisition the use of specialized tools, laboratories, libraries, or other crafting space and equipment to use within the Citadel. When you make an ability check with a set of any specialist’s tools using the Citadel’s equipment, add double your normal proficiency bonus to the check.

#### Resources
The Citadel hosts libraries, museums, record repositories, and training facilities, and you can use them to further your work. You can call in a favor from faculty members to access resources not available to the public—dangerous relics or magic items, spellbooks, gear, and the like. Additionally, you can consult with the faculty of the Citadel as the experts in various fields.

#### Training
The Citadel retains knowledgeable tutors in subjects pertinent to its interests. When you undertake the training downtime activity (as described in the Player’s Handbook and Xanathar’s Guide to Everything), the training takes half as long. The DM decides if the Citadel has tutors available for a given subject.

<!--
### Guild Contact
Even as a member in good standing of the guild, you can’t simply stroll up to the guild master and demand their attention. Your superiors within the guild manage work contracts, request the use of guild resources, and facilitate getting your group in contact with the right people to assist their interests.

### Attentive Overseer
A guild representative takes personal interest in your group’s tasks. They follow your exploits and know of your adventures before you return to report. Despite the unsettling depth of their knowledge, they seem genuinely eager to shepherd your work. -->

# The Cult of the Dragon

The plots of the Cult of the Dragon are secret, but its existence is not. Most folk of the Lands have heard of the cult, but know only that its members revere evil dragons. The cult recruits new members in major cities, and word quickly gets around. Moreover, many cultists engage in legitimate business or are assigned to ordinary academic research. Only a relative few "supposedly" serve as thieves, assassins, and spies.

Dragon-themed symbolism and iconography pervade the cult’s official regalia—black clothing that features a cape or cloak cut to resemble dragon wings, and festooned with jewelry and draconic imagery reflecting the wearer’s favorite type of dragon. Masks are common at cult gatherings.
 

<!-- So far the cult has recovered the five dragon masks and collected an immense treasure worthy of the Dragon Queen. All that now remains is to raise her temple in the Well of Dragons, sacrifice hundreds of victims whose souls will power an ancient ritual, and then use that ritual to open a portal through which Tiamat will emerge from the Nine Hells. -->

### History

The Cult of the Dragon has existed for centuries. During most of that time, its members have focused on the creation and worship of dracoliches, based on a prophecy translated by the cult’s founder, Sammaster. However, those goals changed with the rise of a young cultist named Severin.

Inspired by Tiamat, Severin reexamined the texts translated by Sammaster and discovered a different interpretation, believing that “naught will be left save shattered thrones, with no rulers but the dead. Dragons shall rule the world entire ...” Severin’s quest to reshape the cult led him to the dragon Hoondarrh, “the Red Rage of Mintarn.” 

<!-- The fact that Severin not only survived this encounter but befriended the dragon impressed Tiamat in her exile in the Nine Hells. As a reward and further test, she allowed Severin a scrap of knowledge regarding the existence of the five dragon masks. 

 Severin took that bit of information and did what few others could have accomplished, searching for and finding all five masks. The task took years to complete, and it led directly to the crisis that Faerûn now faces.

Severin kept the red mask for himself. As other masks were found, he presented them to his closest allies in the Cult of the Dragon, granting each the power of a wyrmspeaker. Using the magic of the dragon masks, this Inner Circle of Wyrmspeakers helps Severin prepare the way for Tiamat’s return. 
-->
### Structure

The cult has a simple hierarchical structure, consisting of initiates on the bottom, four ranks for cultists, and one highest rank for “Wearers of Purple”—the lords, leaders, and cult masters of particular locales. 
<!--
The cult is ruled by a secretive inner group led by Severin and four other wyrmspeakers—a term of respect given to those whose bond with dragons is supernaturally strong. 
-->
Rank in the cult is based on merit and fanaticism. As raw recruits, initiates (represented by cultists and cult fanatics) have no rank and follow the orders of their superiors. 
<!--
Only initiates that prove their worth are allowed to advance. A Wearer of Purple can promote an initiate along the track of dragonclaw (first rank), dragonwing (second rank), dragonfang (third rank), and dragonsoul (fourth rank). 

Cult operation groups are assembled to match their assigned tasks. They vary in size, from a few low-ranking cultists operating on their own to hundreds of cultists of various ranks under the control of multiple Wearers of Purple.-->

<!--
### Wearers of Purple

The Wearers of Purple stand at the top of the cult’s humanoid hierarchy, and their word is law for the cultists in the cities, strongholds, and lairs they command. They are the only members of the cult to wear purple, and most are proud enough to flaunt the color. The Wearers of Purple have an affinity for talking to and negotiating with dragons—the gift of wyrmspeaking. Dozens of Wearers of Purple are spread throughout the Cult of the Dragon, and all are able to marshal the cult’s resources.

Only Severin’s inner circle can promote a dragonsoul to a Wearer of Purple, granting that character a base of operations and funds. Most new Wearers of Purple have already developed a working relationship with a dragon as part of their power and authority. Those who do not cultivate and expand this relationship are sometimes demoted. A number of priests of Tiamat have recently been made Wearers of Purple, and have been charged with establishing temples for her open worship in Fal'doren. This aspect of the cult’s plans is still in the early stages, and the inner circle remains divided on how the Cult of the Dragon should interact with the faithful of Tiamat.

### The Inner Circle

These four Wearers of Purple are the keepers of the dragon masks and Severin’s most devoted servants in the effort to summon Tiamat. Each of these wyrmspeakers bears one of the dragon masks, which they never part with except under the direst circumstances—and then only at the request of Severin or a draconic ally. The members of the inner circle each have an affinity for a particular color of chromatic dragon. They treat with dragons of those colors to recruit more dragons to the cause, and plan cult missions that advance Severin’s plots.

In addition to Severin, the Red Wyrmspeaker, the members of the inner circle are: Galvan (male human), the Blue Wyrmspeaker; Neronvain (male moon elf), the Green Wyrmspeaker and son of Melandrach, King of the Misty Forest; Rezmir (female half-black dragon), the Black Wyrmspeaker; and Varram (male dwarf), the White Wyrmspeaker.

If any wyrmspeakers are killed or captured in your campaign—including Rezmir, who the characters might have defeated in Hoard of the Dragon Queen—Severin appoints new followers to his inner council. -->
:
Should Players wish to join the Cult of the Dragon, they need to prove and pledge their allegiance to a Chromatic Dragon that a sect of the Cult reveres. If you succeed, you can find your Group Patron information below.
## Criminal Syndicate Perks
With the criminal syndicate as your group’s patron, you gain the following perks.

#### Assignments
The syndicate doesn’t pay you directly, but it assigns you to particular tasks on behalf of its clients or the organization. Someone hires the syndicate to perform a task (such as an assassination), and the syndicate passes 85 percent of the fee on to your group. If the aim is to enrich the syndicate (such as by pulling off a heist), you have the privilege of keeping 85 percent of what you steal. Other syndicates take more or less than a 15 percent share, at the DM’s discretion.
<!--
#### Contraband
You have access to your syndicate’s business in contraband, such as poisons or narcotics. You don’t receive a discount on these goods, but you can always find someplace to purchase them.
-->
#### Fences
Members or associates of your syndicate are skilled at disposing of stolen goods, and you have access to this service as well. Fences are useful for selling not just illicit goods but also expensive items such as works of art and magic items. In the case of magic items, this allows you to delegate the work of finding a buyer (a downtime activity described in the Dungeon Master’s Guide and Xanathar’s Guide to Everything) to the fence. When using the syndicate’s fences, you run no risk of a double-cross or other mishap in finding a buyer, but the syndicate takes 20 percent of the sale price as a finder’s fee.

#### Safe Houses
The syndicate maintains safe houses or other secret hiding spots across a wide region. Your group knows how to locate these nondescript redoubts and can maintain a poor lifestyle in one for no cost. Revealing a safe house, whether purposefully or by accident, causes you to lose favor with the syndicate and may see you banned from using them.

#### Syndicate-Owned Businesses
The syndicate owns several businesses, primarily as fronts for laundering money. When you buy from one of these businesses, you get a 5 percent discount. The DM decides what goods and services are available.

# The Miristar

The Miristar were once a secret ancient order of Keepers of Nature, but have since been wiped out. Since the time of **The Fracture** the world came to know of the exploits of the secretive Miristar. **The Tarrleyan Forests** were home to the Miristar before it seemingly vanished in the now vast **Tarrel Desert**. It's lush flora spanning the horizon even from the peaks of **Atlas** itself, many saw the Forests as the peak of nature itself, and those who cared for it were among the strongest and most dedicated Druids.

The Miristar's Order was not dissimilar to that of **The Arcance Citadel**, but whereas the Citadel operates in the light under the guise of a respectable order pursuing the preservation of Good and the extinction of Evil, the Miristar were the opposite side of the same coin.

The Miristar were an order of Good-Aligned peoples, that worked towards the preservation of the balance of nature and civilization, culling any threats to either society. In this way, the Miristar were excellent spies and infiltrators into many different Governments, Guilds, and Cults; finding the rot, and cutting it out.

However, since the near extinction of their people, the Miristar disbanded, revealing themselves in documents released to the public. The documents revealed that the original Miristar Order was in the near tens of thousands strong, but after the Fracture, were left with nearly less than 100 memebers. Since the order was so secretive, nearly all history or information shared together was done orally. In a final meeting of its remaining members, the Miristar realized their collective knowledge was miniscule in comparison to what they believed they knew, and as such, decided to disband and reveal the work they had done for the world.
::
Should any Players wish to join the Miristar, they would need to find a retired memeber, and convince them of their dedication to a now dead cause. Should the DM find this reason worthwhile, you can find your Group Patron information below.
## Ancient Being Perks
With the ancient being as your group’s patron, you gain the following perks.

#### Equipment
Your patron’s network has access to certain magic items. You can purchase common magic items from your patron contact. The DM determines the available stock or can call for a group Intelligence (Investigation) check to ascertain if the ancient being’s network can successfully locate a desired item. The DC for this check is 10 in a city, 15 in a town, and 20 in a village. If the check fails, 1d8 days must pass before the same item can be searched for again in that community.

The DM sets the price of a common magic item or determines it randomly: 2d4 × 10 gp, or half as much for a consumable item such as a potion or scroll.

#### Research
Relying on an ancient being’s network of contacts, the being’s vast collection of lore, or perhaps the being’s direct teaching helps you unearth hidden secrets. If you can contact your patron or their agents, your group makes ability checks made to research lore related to your patron’s interests and influence with advantage.

#### Sanctuary
Your patron’s agents have safe houses or other secure gatherings spread across a wide region. Your group knows how to locate these friendly enclaves and can maintain a modest lifestyle in one for no cost. In return, you must defend the sanctuary or protect the secret of its existence.

#### Strange Gifts
Your patron grants your group a small measure of esoteric power. At 5th level, and again at 13th, you gain one supernatural gift as described in the treasure chapter of the Dungeon Master’s Guide. The DM determines which supernatural gifts are available.

### Ancient Being Contact
The organizational contact who dispenses assignments or delivers the word of your patron runs the gamut from prosaic to otherworldly. Roll or pick from the Ancient Being Contact table to determine who or what conveys your patron’s will.

#### Visions
Your patron doesn’t use intermediaries, instead speaking to you in dreams, omens, or visions. The being appears in your mind as you sleep, taking control of your dreams to deliver instructions that become difficult to ignore.

# The Rakk'Mera

The Rakk'Mera can be best described as a religious fenatic group that permeates throughout all the cities of Fal'Doren. Many consider the Rakk'Mera to be naysayers to the Prime Dieities and the rest of the gods, proclaiming the only true gods are the Sun and the Moon. Some even go so far as to call them "doom sayers".

None really know where the sect got their name from, and when questioned, the Rakk'Mera always deflect their answers, attempting to indoctrinate at any passing moment. While the Rakk'Mera always seem to get a bad reputation publicly, privately Adventurers would know they're more collectors of Ancient Religious Relics.

Like any collector, the Rakk'Mera are closed off and extremely private. While they do collect many religious artifacts, they are not so keen on sharing their findings with others in the same space. Should any adventurers choose to share their own artifacts with the Rakk'Mera, they may find themselves a powerful and knowledgeable ally.
::
Should any Players wish to join the Rakk'Mera, they would need to gift the sect with a highly valuable Ancient Relic. Additionally, if there is a religious member of the party, they would have to denounce their god and instead swear fealty to the Rakk'Mera's Pantheon.
### Relic Collectors
This order of archaeologist-monks seeks to fill their museum-like temple with storied holy relics.
## Religious Order Perks
Your group acts in the service of a religious institution. The patronage of a religious order isn’t simply a matter of each member of your party belonging to the same faith, though. The faith’s administration—with its own resources, goals, and leaders—directly sponsors and guides your adventures.
:
With a religious order as your group’s patron, you gain the following perks.

#### Divine Service
In times of need, your group can appeal to the priests of your faith for magical aid. An NPC cleric or druid of your faith who is of sufficiently high level casts any spell of up to 5th level on your group’s behalf, without charge. The caster provides any costly material components needed for the spell, as long as you demonstrate your need and are in good standing with the faith.

#### Equipment
Each member of your party has a holy symbol or druidic focus, even if it isn’t needed for spellcasting. Each of you also has a book containing prayers, rites, and scriptures of your faith.

#### Proficiencies
Each member of your party gains proficiency in the Religion skill, if the character doesn’t already have it.

### Religious Order Contact
Your established order enjoys a robust following. It might be a cloister of priestly scholars who use your group as the adventuring arm of the organization, or perhaps a legion of paladins who call on your group’s finesse where swords and shields fail. You might receive orders directly from the immortal entity you worship or through an earthly agent, such as a high priest or an archdruid.

#### Mysterious Text
The gradual translation of a secret holy text points you toward the next step of a divine destiny.

### Religious Order Quests
The services you provide your religious order vary depending on the deity you serve and your party’s aptitudes. Regardless, religious orders are opposed by antagonistic faiths, foes whose rivalry with your order emulates the conflict between your respective gods. Some religious orders also hunt and destroy fiends, undead, or other beings they consider abominations, seeking to rid the word of their influence. Others root out heretics, real or imagined, to demonstrate the primacy of their deity.

#### Relic Recovery
You seek a lost symbol of the order discovered in a dangerous place or in the hands of an enemy.

# The Guild Bearers

The Guild Bearers are the largest conglomerate of crafters, merchants, and artisans. In any city in the world you can find workshops, blacksmiths, tanners, and the like all proudly displaying the Sigil of the Guild Bearers in their shop. In fact, it's more rare to see someone in business that isn't displaying the mark of the Guild Bearers.

While they are the dominant work force in the world, Artisans of the craft have a much bigger notoriety than that of the common "Mom n' Pop" shops of the Lands. **Guild Halls** are a rare commodity, but grant access to some of the most upscale and state-of-the-art tools and work stations. Plenty of crafters get their start in their local shops, but at the end of the line: Guild Halls are the cream of the crop.

Commissioning work from an artisan of the Guild Bearers can come at quite the cost. However, the value of the commission will far outweigh its cost. The term, "Worth it's weight in Gold" was coined by a Guild Bearer themselves, after they created Golden Crowns for the Leadership within **Atlas.**

Working with the Guild Bearers you can commission Magical Items, Tools, or even custom items of your own creation that could help you along your adventuring journey. If you can gain access to a **Guild Hall** within a major city, the possiblities are endless.
:
Should any Players wish to join the Guild Bearers, they would need to become a least an Expert Crafter in their chosen Profession. If you gain access to the Guild Bearers Hall, you can find your Group Patron information below.
## Guild Perks
With a guild as your group’s patron, you gain the following perks. These perks require an annual contribution of 15 gp paid to the guild (replacing the 5 gp per month cost for characters with the Guild Artisan background). These dues fund the guild’s services and activities.
:
#### Accommodations
You can stay at your organization’s guildhall. The rooms are comparable to those in a comfortable inn, but at a modest price (5 sp per day).

#### Equipment
You can requisition the use of specialized tools, laboratories, libraries, or other crafting space and equipment to use within the guildhall. When you make an ability check with a set of artisan’s tools using the guild’s equipment, add double your normal proficiency bonus to the check.
\column
#### Resources
You can leverage the guild’s extensive contacts to locate exotic materials for crafting, spell components, or magic items, or buyers for them (a downtime activity in the Dungeon Master’s Guide and Xanathar’s Guide to Everything). You can locate or sell legal commodities using the guild’s resources, and any prices tip in your favor by 10 percent.

#### Training
The guild retains knowledgeable tutors in subjects pertinent to its interests. When you undertake the training downtime activity (as described in the Player’s Handbook and Xanathar’s Guide to Everything), the training takes half as long if you are studying a subject the guild specializes in. The DM decides if the guild has tutors available for a given subject.

### Guild Contact
Even as a member in good standing of the guild, you can’t simply stroll up to the guild master and demand their attention. Your superiors within the guild manage work contracts, request the use of guild resources, and facilitate getting your group in contact with the right people to assist their interests.

#### The Perfectionist
Your contact is a skilled but obsessive creator consumed with the quest to create something perfect that will define their life’s work and secure their legacy. They lose sight of right and wrong in pursuit of the finest materials and exciting opportunities.

# Character Options
Listed throughout this section is a multitude of character options that are available for your players. Each section is detailed below to inform you how intricate each section can be. From Race Options, Hero Classes, Character Origins, Mythical Feats and Class feats, and even the Mythical Magic Items, you'll be able to find everythin you need.

## Hero Classes

Hero Classes are meant to be mid-late game archetypes that can be unlock via a special event. Unless specified, Hero Classes act as a "mask" on top of your original class selections. For instance, **The Maledicter** Hero Class can only be taken afer 10 level, meaning any class features you would have gotten for your class from levels 1-10 will be included in *all additional* class features obtained via The Maledicter.

{{note
Example:

You are a 10th Level Fighter, who then becomes a Maledicter. You keep all Fighter Hit points, Features, and Class abilites up to 10th level. From 11th Level on, you will no longer gain any Fighter Features, but instead follow the Maledicter path for the remainder of your characters' life span. Multi-classing post Hero Class selection is unavailable.
}}

## Race Options

While the world of Fal'Doren is vast, it is not limitless. Some races found in official and supplimental D&D 5e books will be unavilable in this setting. As such some restrictions have been put in place to help maintain narrative. A few additional Races have been included for character options, and you may even find a few rare NPCs touting such races.
\column
## Character Origins

Character Origins are an experimental option for character creation. They offer expanded power early on in a character's development and help create pre-adventuring narrative hooks. Consult your DM before you choose one of these options, as some may or may not fit within the overarching narrative being told.

## Mythical Feats

One of the most powerful aspects of Character Growth within Fal'Doren is the addition of Mythical Feats. More powerful than published offical Feats, Mythical Feats are custom tailored to be as powerful as possible, with the added caveat that they can't be chosen, only rewarded.

## Mythical Class Feats

Following the same concepts as Mythical Feats, Class Feats are Class specific. All class feats are made with the desire to include all subclasses. Whereas traditional feats may attempt to focus power into a specific archetype, Mythical Class Feats can be used by the Classes, and not specifically their Subclasses.

All classes benefit in some way from their Class Feats, enhancing their base abilites and allowing them to become even more powerful versions of themselves.

## Mythical Magic Items

Mythical Magic Items, are just that, *Myth.* These items are nearly impossible to obtain, being locked away in extraplanar vaults, wielded by Gods themselves, or simply lost to time. While they are certainly "obtainable," coming into possesstion of one may take the course of an entire campagin, or seeking them out with surgical precision over the course of multiple large adventures.

- Summon up to 3 devils a day, whose Challenge Rating is less than or equal to your Player Level.

Abstaining from writing or signing contracts will invoke the following penalties:

- You maintain a minimum of 2 levels of **exhaustion**.
- Devils will no longer be allied to you or your party.

A Duality Clause allows for the *Benefactor* (You) to not only gain the profits of the *Consideration*, but to also gain ***all Benefits*** pertaining to the *Offer.* Additionally, you are **exempt** from any and all *Breach of Contract* clauses should the *Signee* fail to meet the contract.

The more contracts you write and sign, the more power you can obtain. However, should any contracts be nullified for any reason, you lose all power accumulated with said contract in perpetuity and retroactively.

If you attempt to heal in this way, you do not provoke attacks of opportunity.

### Beacon of Life
At 10th level, you and any allies within a 15ft radius of you are under the effect of the spell beacon of hope. A creature that is not on the same plane as you cannot benefit from this feature. This features range increases to 30ft at 17th level.

## Class Features
As a magus, you gain the following class features, which are summarized in the Magus table.

### Arcane Guard
*1st-level Magus feature*

Your arcane prowess defends yourself and others from harm. Your arcane guard is an energy pool that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can create a total number of temporary hit points equal to your magus level × 5.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to grant a number of temporary hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 temporary hit points from your pool of shielding to neutralize one of the following conditions currently affecting the creature: charmed, paralyzed, petrified, or stunned. You can dispel multiple effects with a single use of Arcane Guard, expending temporary hit points separately for each one.

### Spellsight
*1st-level Magus feature*

You have honed your senses to notice subtle signs of magic in the world around you. Beginning at 1st level, you can use an action to open your senses, as if you had cast detect magic. Unlike detect magic, your Spellsight only lasts for 1 round.

If there is a creature within range of your Spellsight, you can choose to focus your senses on it, excluding everything else. You learn the creature's spellcasting ability (if it has one) and the level of the highest spell it can cast. If the creature is hidden from divination magic, it appears as non-magical.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Fighting Style
*2nd-level Magus feature*

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take the same Fighting Style option more than once, even if you get to choose again.

#### Arcane Warrior
You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. They count as magus spells for you, and
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for them.

{{pageNumber,auto}}

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace
one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the wizard spell list.

#### Blind Fighting
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness.

Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you.

#### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### Interception
When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting
You can engage in two-weapon fighting with any one-handed melee weapons you are wielding that aren't heavy.

In addition, you can draw or stow two one-handed weapons when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one.
\page

### Spellstrike
*2nd-level Magus feature*

You can blend your arcane and martial skills in ways unique to the magi. As a bonus action, while you hold a melee weapon, you can expend a spell slot to cast a magus spell of 1st-level or higher, imbuing it in your weapon, so long as the spell meets the following requirements:

The spell must have a casting time of one action.
The spell must require a single attack roll, force a saving throw, or effect a number of hit points worth of creatures.
The first time you hit a creature with a weapon imbued with a spell, the target of the attack becomes the target of the imbued spell along with the weapon's normal damage.

If you imbue a weapon with a spell that targets an area, only the creature hit by the weapon suffers the spell's effect. If the spell requires a saving throw, the creature makes the saving throw with disadvantage when hit by the attack.

Each weapon can bear a single spell. Imbuing another spell into that weapon dispels any previous spell. Spells imbued in a weapon are consumed on hit. Unused spells dispel at the end of your next long rest.

### Esoteric Order of Arcanists
Magi who join the Order of Arcanists often serve wizards and other learned practitioners of the arcane. While most magi only study magic for use in combat, those who join this Order are interested in more specialised uses of the arcane, putting their focus on a single magic school to aid them in their quest for knowledge.

### Sculpt Spells
*3rd-level Order of Arcanists feature*

You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your spells. When you cast a spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

{{pageNumber,auto}}

### Student of the Arcane
*3rd-level Order of Arcanists feature*

You gain an increased knowledge of the arcane traditions you study. You gain the ability to cast any magus spell you know as a ritual so long as that spell has the ritual tag.

Additionally, you are expertly trained in a specific school of magic, owing to the depth and focus of your training. Choose one of the following schools of magic.

***Abjuration.*** When you choose this school, you learn the blade ward cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known. When you cast blade ward, you can extend the duration to 1 minute while concentrating on it.

***Conjuration***. When you choose this school, you learn the sword burst cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known. When you cast sword burst, you can extend the duration to 1 minute while concentrating on it.

***Divination.*** When you choose this school, you learn the true strike cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known. When you cast true strike, you don't need to concentrate on it.

***Enchantment.*** When you choose this school, you learn the mind sliver cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known. When you cast mind sliver, the target also becomes charmed of you until the end of your next turn if it fails the Intelligence saving throw.

***Evocation.*** When you choose this school, you learn the green-flame blade cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number
\page
{{pageNumber,auto}}

of cantrips known. When you cast green-flame blade, you can add your spellcasting ability modifier to the initial attack as well.

***Illusion.*** When you choose this school, you learn the minor butterfly blade cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known. When you cast butterfly blade, any creature making a melee attack against you while the illusion is in effects takes 1d4 psychic damage on a hit.

***Necromancy.*** When you choose this school, you learn the toll the dead cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known. When you cast toll the dead, the target also becomes frightened of you until the end of your next turn if it fails the Wisdom saving throw.

***Transmutation.*** When you choose this school, you learn the thorn whip cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known. When you cast thorn whip, the target is pulled up to 20 feet towards you.

### Extra Attack
*5th-level Magus feature*

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Aegis
*6th-level Magus feature*

You learn to produce an Aegis, a protective weave of arcane power that disrupts incoming spells. As a reaction when you take damage from a spell or another magical effect, you can spend a spell slot to reduce the damage. The damage is reduced by 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st.

If you use your Aegis to reduce the damage of an incoming spell or magical effect to zero, the entire effect is immediately dispelled and doesn't take effect on you, or any other creature that may have been targeted by the spell or effect.

### Arcane Recovery
*7th-level Order of Arcanists feature*

Casting the spells of your school comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a spell from your chosen school of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the spell you cast and can't be higher than 3rd level.
\column
### Spellsunder
*10th-level Magus feature*

You can empower the weapons you wield with powerful abjuration magic. When you hit a creature or object that is under the effects of a spell or attack a spell directly (such as an unseen servant or tiny hut), you can attempt to dispel the spell as if you cast dispel magic at a level equal to your highest level magus spell slot.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. If you have no uses remaining you can expend a spell slot of any level to use it again.

### Arcane Strikes
*11th-level Magus feature*

Your attacks are imbued with arcane power. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you deal an additional 1d8 damage to the target. This damage must be of a type dealt by a magus spell you know.

### Greater Aegis
*14th-level Magus feature*

When you empower your Aegis with a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher and reduce the damage of an incoming spell or effect to zero, you regain an expended spell slot. The spell slot you regain must be of a level lower than the spell slot you expended to empower your Aegis.

### Esoteric Arcana
*15th-level Order of Arcanists feature*

Your expertise in the arcane expands even further. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher from your chosen school that targets only one creature, you can have it target a second creature.

### Greater Spellsunder
*18th-level Magus feature*

Your magic can cut through the most powerful arcane spells. When you attack a spell directly with Spellsunder (such as a resilient sphere or wall of force), you dispel the spell automatically as if it had been targeted by a disintegrate spell.

### Grand Arcanist

## Astral Elf
Long ago, groups of elves ventured from the Feywild to the Astral Plane to be closer to their gods. Life in the Silver Void has imbued their souls with a spark of divine light. That light manifests as a starry gleam in an astral elf’s eyes.

Because nothing ages on the Astral Plane, astral elves who inhabit that plane can be very old, and their longevity gives them an unusual perspective on the passage of time. Some are prone to melancholy, while others might display an absence of feeling. Many look for creative ways to occupy themselves. Whether they choose to live in quiet contemplation or strike out to explore the reaches of the multiverse, astral elves tend to see things through the lens of time as having little or no meaning to them. Astral elves who don’t dwell on the Astral Plane can live to be more than 1000 years old. 

### Astral Elf Traits
As an astral elf player character, you have the following traits.
Creature Type
You are a Humanoid. You are also considered an elf for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be an elf.

#### Size
You are Medium.

#### Speed
Your walking speed is 30 feet.
\column
#### Astral Fire
You know one of the following cantrips of your choice: **dancing lights**, **light**, or **sacred flame**. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it (choose when you select this race).

#### Darkvision
You can see in dim light within 60 feet of yourself as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

#### Fey Ancestry
You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself.

#### Keen Senses
You have proficiency in the **Perception** skill.

#### Starlight Step
As a bonus action, you can magically teleport </br> up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you</br> can see. You can use this trait a number of </br> times equal to your proficiency bonus, and </br> you regain all  expended uses when you </br>finish a long rest.

#### Astral Trance
You don’t need to sleep,  and magic </br> can’t put you to sleep. You can </br>finish a long rest in 4 hours if </br> you spend those hours in a </br> trancelike meditation, during </br> which you remain conscious.

Whenever you finish </br>this trance, you  </br>gain proficiency </br> in one skill of </br>your choice and </br> with one </br> weapon or tool </br>of your choice, </br> selected from the </br>Player’s Handbook.</br> You mystically acquire </br>these proficiencies by</br> drawing them from shared elven </br>memory and the experiences of entities</br> on the Astral Plane, and you retain them </br>until you finish your next long rest.

##### Male Astral Elf

## Shifter 
Shifters are sometimes called </br> weretouched, as they are descendants of </br>people who contracted full or partial</br> lycanthropy. Humanoids with a bestial </br>aspect, shifters can’t fully change</br> shape, but they can temporarily 
\page
enhance their animalistic features by entering a state they call shifting.

Shifters are similar to humans in height and </br> build but are typically more lithe and flexible. 
Their facial features have a bestial cast, often with large eyes and pointed ears; most shifters also have prominent canine teeth. They grow fur-like hair on nearly every part of their bodies. While a shifter’s appearance might remind an onlooker of an animal, they remain clearly identifiable as shifters even when at their most feral.

Most shifters resemble a particular kind of lycanthrope. You can choose the kind of lycanthrope in your past, or you can determine it randomly by rolling on the Lycanthrope Ancestor table. The table also provides a suggestion for the Shifting option you might have as a result of your ancestry.

Johnny would run the bar in the mid morning to mid afternoon, and his brother Joeseph would take over at night. The pair would consistently fake who they were, leaning into perposterous rumors that 'Johnny O' would never sleep, but only watch the bar.

Mayor Clask is an exploitative and manipulative narcissist. Installed as the Mayor of Terris by the Thieves Guild, Clask consistently manipulates the market in his favor, and blindly ignores the public demand for a harsher crack down on crime.

In fact, Clask turns a blind eye to most wrong doings within the town as a whole. While the Guard may arrest criminals, they're usually back out on the street within a few days time. While Clask may seem untouchable, there are those in the Thieves Guild that are starting to regret their appointments.
